I arrived in Kuching with the feeling I was getting away from my own life, going to an unfamilliar place of which I knew precisely nothing. As I drove in, I could see nearly everything was shuttered for the Chinese New Year, pretty well across the whole town. This persisted up until I was in my room, where the powerful outside light was blocked by a curtain, preventing the room from becoming too hot. I looked at the paper map I'd picked up, and got settled in.

I then ventured out at around 5pm, to spot a potential running route and get a lay of the land (and river). There was a pleasant warm and rustic quality about the air, reminding me of a previous trip. I walked along to a new bridge construction, slightly impractical and unwieldy but popular with the locals. From there, I heard the city's call to prayer fill the sunset landscape in a few moments of activity, before silence fell again and I made my way through empty gardens and construction sites.
