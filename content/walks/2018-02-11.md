Did the well known Dragon's Back trail over the weekend. Very clear day, felt out of breath almost immediately while climbing up the stairs from a bus stop on the side of the road going up to the highest point. From there, a sheer drop down to Shek O, a slightly bohemian looking village, with a few big houses and a golf course prominently visible.

We walked for a long while, with no water, forking off at the end into a bay with only a few houses around and full of surfers. The loop is suddendly closed when minibuses appear out of nowhere to bring us back to civilisation.
