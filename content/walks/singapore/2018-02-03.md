Went on a nice walk from Khatib to the Seletar Airport. Feelings of going further and further away into the unknown until wilderness.
I was slightly better prepared this time than on previous spontaneous walks I have done, with my worn-out trekking shoes I've owned since I was 16 and a container of water, providing timely hydration under the hot sun.

For this walk, I made good use of the bike sharing apps that have resulted in bikes being dumped pretty much everywhere. Even one of the oldest ones, leaking from the rain, gave me enough to go on without getting too tired or wasting too much time.

At the end of the walk, I found high gates and wire seemingly surrounding the island, cutting off access to the sea.
