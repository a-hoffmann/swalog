Hi, I'm Alex. 

Brit/Swiss living in Singapore, writing about technology, travel, and observations in general.

Creating this blog as a way of learning how to make one without too many moving parts and dependencies that I don't master. 

It's also just to express myself a little, forming my opinions and impressions, and sharing these for discussion. 

Looking forward to the experience!
