A long time since any update happened on this website, I have no good excuse for this as my attention is monopolised by all kinds of other things that are truly unimportant in comparison. Trying to figure out where the future might take me, how I can balance what I like doing with what I can do well (might be something to do with writing if I'm lucky, or at the very least something that would in some way mark a change).

I'm also only a few days away from completing a seemingly significant achievement of the year: a half-marathon for which I've gone out running 4 times a week on average, a happy medium in therapies of mental sanity and weight loss. Something to keep doing going forward, maybe venturing out into the longer distances.

General feelings about the world at large are still somewhere in the pits. Climate change is now no longer controversial and is seen as an inevitability - no one takes the lead on this most important global issue. Instead we prefer to consume the news cycle as it unfolds, making everyone miserable but occasionally quite funny, as biting irony becomes the default behavoir.

Media consumed:

* Mad Men: this had a not small impact on me, even though most things do. More to say on this sometime soon.
* Silk Roads (P. Frankopan): an excellent book. History as seen through the centre of Eurasia with changing people, borders, routes.
* Not terribly much else I can think of at the moment. All the rest wasn't that good (although maybe also worth talking about!)
