The first post
-------------


*Hello*, I'm testing a **new** blog post system out.

Hope it works _out of the box_, and supports my ideas of workflow which I will get started in making soon!

The idea would be to have a place to jot down some ideas, and share some experiences.I'll try to walk a tone somewhere between formal and informal, being all at once a personal blog and a platform for other ideas.
