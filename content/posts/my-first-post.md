The first post
-------------


*Hello*, I'm testing a **new** blog post system out.

Hope it works _out of the box_, and supports my ideas of workflow which I will get started in making soon!

After some searching I fell on Hugo. Having previously had some experience with Drupal and Wordpress, I didn't want to go down that way again with the modules to install et al, and prefered to build something more grounded in smaller building blocks. A static website generator, focusing on words and a simple layout, seemed a good way to achieve the basic requirements and build more on top of it. I used the documentation on [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io), which has all the information needed to get started.

The idea would be to have a place to jot down some ideas, and share some experiences. I'll try to walk a tone somewhere between formal and informal, being all at once a personal blog and a platform for other ideas.
