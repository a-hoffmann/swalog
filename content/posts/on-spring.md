It’s already well past mid-Feb and I find life continuing in a steady day by day here.
Between listening to Africa by Toto almost exclusively, running and making plans that I will get round to doing at some point. At work, to get further insight on where new innovation lies in tech, I read the constant chatter of news and bad takes the internet is full of. I’ve recently started flipping through windows and tabs using the keyboard in earnest, which makes accelerated multi-tasking a breeze.

However, parallel plans I’ve been making are proving difficult to hold down by competing distractions, and the only area where progress is manifest is the running, around the neighbouring park, at night, lit up in some places and comparatively dark in others. Strava has become my main social media outlet, showing when and where but not why. After that I watch Mad Men, having customarily started the series about 5 years too late to be considered current news. I enjoy the retracing of modern consumerist history without obvious foreshadowings, the way characters are thoughtfully and relatably woven into each other and their struggles.

Through a mix of circumstances I ended up going on a trip last week by myself. Being the Chinese New Year, I found most shops shut down at my destination, giving the streets a kind of quiet eerieness all the while being set up beautifully, with pleasantly bulbous red lanterns strung across the way, seemingly for no one. The tranquility of the place did help, its’ abandonment lessening mine as I [walked]({{.Site.BaseURL}}/walks/2018-02-17) around the streets and out in the parks to let thoughts swirl around in my head more freely.

I was reminded of places I’d visited like this before, where I’ve been left alone to determine my own plans, and try to make sense of a place, to find a rhythm in which I can coexist with what’s around me. The ones that come to mind: Lübeck, Trincomalee, and now Kuching in Sarawak. They challenge me, forcing me to adapt, until I start to “get it”, and feel a sense of relief and sometimes regret on leaving. This time would prove somewhat different, as I felt less alienated and by meeting some travellers, the feelings I brought with me faded away. I take it as a sign that things can change.
